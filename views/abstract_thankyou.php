                        <h3>We've sent your abstract off for review!</h3>
                        <p>You should receive feedback on your abstract within a few days. Our volunteers are notified of new submissions and review them as time permits.</p>
                        <p>In the rare case you haven't received feedback after three days, please submit your abstract again.  We hope this doesn't happen often, but at busy times abstracts can slip by unreviewed.</p>
